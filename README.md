My app allows the user to choose a type of cuisine from a dropdown menu
After that the GUI displays a list of dishes that fall under that specific cuisine
The user can then choose the dish they want
Once they Click on the dish the instructions are displayed
After that they have the option to click the Nutrition Button
If they click that button more information is displayed including
Calories, Fat, Carbs, and Protein
If the recipe is too complicated for the API which is rare the ingrediants are printed in termal
Additionallly an error message is shown to choose a different one

Please be wary when testing as if you do too many requests at once it will shut down
The nutrition takes a couple of seconds to load and do not click it multiple times for one recipe.
